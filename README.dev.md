# Developing Yeonjae Studio

## Prerequisites

- Node 22 LTS (`.nvmrc`), pnpm 10 (`corepack enable` or `npm i -g pnpm@10`)
- Python 3.12 with `jsonschema` for the planning validator (`pip install jsonschema`)
- Postgres 16 with `btree_gist` (bundled) — `DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@127.0.0.1:5432/yeonjae_test`; integration tests skip (visibly) when it is unset

Chapter production runs replay-only in this checkpoint: `chapter:produce` pins the fixture Narrative
Identity on the project, replays `examples/fixture/ch01/replay.ch01.json` (no live provider, no spend),
and prints a JSON summary with workflow/job ids and status (nonzero exit on failure). The workflow id is
deterministic (`chapter:<project>:<ch>`), so repeating `chapter:produce` — or calling `chapter:resume` —
replays completed steps from `job_steps` without re-spending. Example:

```
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://yeonjae:yeonjae@127.0.0.1:5432/yeonjae_test
pnpm cli db:migrate
pnpm cli project:create "Second Awakening"          # -> { projectId }
pnpm cli chapter:produce <projectId> 1              # -> { workflow_id, job_id, status: completed, accepted }
pnpm cli chapter:status chapter:<projectId>:1       # persisted job, steps, llm_calls
pnpm cli export:accepted <projectId>                # accepted chapter 1 summary (add --full for text)
```

## Layout (ADR-0021, ADR-0044)

```
apps/cli            operator surface for the core loop (first app; API/web/worker come in Checkpoint 7)
packages/prose      NFC boundary, code-point addressing, evidence verification, paragraphs, length model,
                    deterministic output-language check
packages/domain     schema loader + Ajv validators, generated types, UUIDv7, StoryClock ordering,
                    lifecycle state machines, Production Policy loader
packages/gateway    fail-closed Narrative Identity Guard, routing table, budget guard, bounded structured-output
                    repair, truncation handling, output-language discard→regenerate→reroute, idempotent audit;
                    MockProvider (fault injection) and ReplayProvider (no silent live calls)
packages/db         migrations (forward-only, hashed; 0004 = jobs workflow_id/idempotency/pins, workflow_artifacts,
                    context packs, embedding sets; 0005 = candidate_selections, the durable N-candidate decision
                    whose row and loser transitions commit in one transaction), pool/transaction helpers,
                    typed repository over the canon
                    schema; canon.commit_delta / canon.rollback_latest are the only canon write paths;
                    retrieval.ts = accepted-only reads for context assembly
packages/canon      deterministic delta verification (schema, evidence, change-class, frame × timeline, future
                    validity) and chapter-acceptance orchestration
packages/narrative  profile store (examples/narrative-profiles), identity composition, Narrative Identity Block
                    compiler (role variants; both contracts first and never shed; hash + separate contract hashes)
packages/prompts    prompt registry: families/<family>/vX.Y.Z/{prompt.json,system.md,user.md}, immutable by
                    content hash, strict template variables, active prompt set
packages/context    Context Packs (ADR-0010/0045): Active Constraint Set compiler, role templates
                    (scene_writer, chapter_planner, continuity_checker, extractor), query plan, structured
                    fetch over accepted canon, Postgres FTS retriever + vector interface, T0–T3 tiering,
                    deterministic ranking, degradation ladder, provenance rendering, manifest + pack hash,
                    pre-call validation
tools/              gen-types.ts, validate-planning-package.py
schemas/ examples/  the contracts and fixture data (validated by CI)
docs/               the plan; status lives only in docs/08-delivery/09-progress.md
```

## Rules of the road

- Schemas first: change `schemas/*.schema.json`, run `pnpm gen:types`, then code (AGENTS.md rule 3).
- All manuscript offsets are Unicode code points into NFC text — use `@yeonjae/prose`, never `string.length`.
- Numbers come from the pinned Production Policy (`examples/production-policies/`), never from code constants.
- No inline production prompts: every call goes through `PromptRegistry` + `Gateway`; new prompt text = new version folder.
- No secrets, no Korean-to-English translation path.
